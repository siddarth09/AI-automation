**Introduction:**

- The never-ending technological advances have brought us here today to live in a digital
    world instead of caves. Artificial Intelligence is now used in every field from Netflix to self-
    driving cars it is everywhere. AI goes one step further by automating tasks such as driving a
    car, providing medical advice or playing chess games, which we thought could never be
    automated. AI can spur growth by replacing labor, which is in finite supply, by capital, which
    is in unbounded supply, both in the production of goods and services and in the production
    of ideas. Minimizing or optimizing the work processes, business processes reengineering
    shifted the industrial age towards the digital age by the help of e-business environments
    would help us create an era of AI.


## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

- We can implement AI with robotics to give robots a 100% increase in efficiency. Just like
    robotics the field of AI is emerging from the ashes, though it is not something new to the
    world, it wasn’t implemented or ‘DEPLOYED’ effectively.
- Now AI, can access your phone, can control your home appliances, can give you better
    suggestions (Netflix), and many more. The field of machine vision and computer vision is
    giving new insights to the people, with the pandemic in the big picture, robots with AI are
    outperforming humans, for example: Face mask detection, classifying images, object
    detection and also self-autonomous vehicles.
- AI can be used in the manufacturing sector to detect any faulty equipment. In the food and
    beverage industry AI can be equipped with sensors to make sure the quality of food, the
    storage, and filling them in containers. These not only create more jobs but also make the
    employee equipped with add-on skills.

## ROBOTICS:

- Robotics Is one of the emerging sectors in technology. Technology has played a role in
    making work more efficient for thousands of years, from simple farming tools to current-day
    assembly-line robots in factories. Robots are becoming present in more and more situations
    in business. They work right alongside human workers or completely replace them.


- Amazon Inc Uses a variety of robots in its warehouses to stock inventory, and retrieve and
    package items. Tesla Motors Inc. boasts robotic and automated assembly lines for its electric
    cars and batteries.

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN AUTOMATION:

- An Intelligent Automation system functions using these three components of artificial
    intelligence. Depending upon the need, they can be combined or used to separately to
    create a fully automated solution:
- **Machine Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing**
- **Machine Learning**

About the project
```
- _Project Exodus is a computer vision based application which classifies a given product as an_
    _OK image or a defect one. Reason for collecting this data is casting defects!_
       - _So what is casting defects?_

_Casting defect is an undesired irregularity in a metal casting process. There are many types of defects
in casting like blow holes, pinholes, burr, shrinkage defects, mould material defects, pouring metal
defects, metallurgical defects, etc._


- _Defects are an unwanted thing in the casting industry. For removing this defective product,_
    _all industries have their quality inspection department. But the main problem is this
inspection process is carried out manually. It is a very time-consuming process and due to
human accuracy, this is not 100% accurate. This can because of the rejection of the whole
order. So it creates a big loss in the company._
- _We decided to make the inspection process automatic and for this, we have build an AI to
solve this problem._

### ABOUT THE DATASET

- **_We have used around 7348 images from KAGGLE PUBLIC DATASET for the model, and the_**
    **_division is as follows_**
- **_Train: - defect-front have 3758 and ok-front have 2875 images_**
- **_Test: - defect-front have 453 and ok-front have 262 images_**
- **_We have used DEEP LEARNING IMAGE CLASSIFCATION technique, we get 98% accuracy on_**
    **_train set and 99% accuracy on Validation set with no overfitting of the model._**

## RESULTS:


## AREA UNDER THE CURVE

- Why AUC is considered as an important metric?
- AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problem at various
    thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of
    separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. **Higher**
    **the AUC, better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. By analogy, Higher the AUC,**
    **better the model is at distinguishing between DEFECT and OK product.**

## EXODUS: AUC


## PHASE 2:

### PLAN OF ACTION:

- **Build a robot to classify the images as DEFECTIVE OR OK**
- **deploy them in real time scenario**
- **change the product according to the user requirements**

**_If we win this competition it would be easy to complete the project and take it to PHASE 3_**

```
1 - DEFECT PRODUCT
```

```
2 - OK PRODUCT
